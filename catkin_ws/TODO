Testing:
	✔ Test the system driving in a straight line instead of spinning @30m @started(20-03-25 13:41) @done(20-03-25 14:14) @lasted(33m17s)
		Localises better when going in a straight line, but the matching is still a bit dodgy...
		There's a bug with the motor code it seems - the jitters when going straight are coming from commanded motor speeds

Development:
	Setup:
		✔ Stitch the camera images together @done(20-03-25 10:52)
			✔ Sync the camera images by approximately stamping them @started(20-03-25 09:34) @done(20-03-25 10:27) @lasted(53m10s)
			✔ Use 50% blending for the image stitching @done(20-03-25 10:28)
			✔ Use linear blending @started(20-03-25 10:45) @done(20-03-25 10:52) @lasted(7m16s)
		☐ Calibrate the cameras to do proper stereo registration
	
	Localisation:
	 ☐ Assume the robot is at the same place at startup
	 ✔ Use a "sliding window" to cull the possible image matches @20m @started(20-03-25 14:33) @done(20-03-25 14:44) @lasted(11m59s)
	 ✔ Downsample the matching resolution significantly (should lead to more robust performance) @started(20-03-25 10:53) @done(20-03-25 11:16) @lasted(23m22s)

Bugs: 
	ROS:
		✔ Subscribing to camera before setting camera options results in receiving empty message @20m @started(20-03-25 13:12) @done(20-03-25 13:28) @lasted(16m57s)

	Miro:
		☐ When commanding Miro to drive straight, it tends to turn right. `/miro/sensors/wheel_speed_cmd` shows the right wheel speed sometimes set to 0.
